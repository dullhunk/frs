Dear Bon

I'm writing to you following on from your talk at our graduation ceremony last year.

I was wondering if you'd be willing and able to give a guest lecture to first year students, as outlined at http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/industry/guest-lectures/

I have slots available in March on Thursdays at 11am if you'd like to come along and talk about whatever you think students might like to hear about (entrep)

We'd be delighted to have you visit the School again if you are able to.

Yours Sincerely

Dr. Duncan Hull
Lecturer in Computer Science
University of Manchester
