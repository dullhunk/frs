I am currently unavailable and taking part in the University and College Union's (UCU) strike action to defend our right to a fair pension. I expect to be back in the office on Friday 10th March unless the strike action is called off. If you are a student, please redirect your query to university management (PresidentDirect@manchester.ac.uk) asking them to finalise the negotiations with UCU as soon as possible https://www.ucu.org.uk/why-we-are-taking-action-over-USS
